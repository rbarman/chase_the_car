Simple Augmented Reality app built with AR.js

How to view app:
- Open https://rbarman.github.io/chase_the_car/ in mobile chrome browser
- Accept permission requests for camera and location
- Move the phone around. You should see a 3D car near you
- (Optional) Download as a native app. While viewing the website, go settings and select "Install App". You should now have a native app installed on your phone that you can interact with. This is possible because the app is built as a progressive web app (PWA).

Deployment
- AR.js docs state that HTTPs deployment is required due to browser restrictions with camera and gps permissions
- Github pages or netlify are easy and free options to deploy. This app is currently deployed with github pages: https://rbarman.github.io/chase_the_car/
